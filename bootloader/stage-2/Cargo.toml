# By default, Rust uses unwinding to run the destructors of all live stack
# variables in case of a panic. This ensures that all used memory is freed and
# allows the parent thread to catch the panic and continue execution.
# Unwinding, however, is a complicated process and requires some OS-specific
# libraries, so we donâ€™t want to use it for our operating system.
# Rust provides an option to abort on panic instead.
