/* ==== FEATURES ============================================================ */
/*  This is a bare metal implementation. This means that the final binary won't
    be linked to the standard library that interacts with the operating system,
    since there is not operating system (hence, bare metal).
    no_std tells the compiler not to link the standard library. */
#![no_std]

/*  Freestanding executable, no access to Rust runtime and crt0.
    We need to define our own entry point overwriting the crt0 one directly.
    no_main tells the compiler not to use the normal entry point chain. */
#![no_main]

/*  Add the message() method to the PanicInfo struct in order to retrieve the
    reason and print it to the screen when the panic_handler is triggered. */

/* ==== CONSTANTS =========================================================== */

/// Could also directly define the pointer as '*const extern "C" fn()->!'.

/* ==== ENTRY POINT ========================================================= */
//// All the code written here is underneath the .text.rs_start section.
//// The _start section is then placed above all else by the linker script.
//// core::arch::global_asm!(".section .text.rs_start");

/// A main doesnâ€™t make sense without an underlying runtime that calls it.
/// We are overwriting the os entry point with our own _start function.
/// The no_mangle attribute ensures that the compiler outputs the
/// function with name _start and not some cryptic unique name symbol.
/// We also have to mark the function as extern "C" to tell the compiler that
/// it should use the C calling convention for this function
/// (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions).
/// 
//// DS, SS, ES are set to 0x10, refers to 32pm data segment selector.
//// CS register is set to 0x08, refers to 32pm code segment selector.
//// SP is set to 0; since it grows backwards, it will wrap around the segment.
/// RAM size for this device (VM) is 128MB (134_217_728 or 0x800_0000 byte).
/// "Wrapping around" doesn't work: 0xFFFFFFFF isn't always a valid address.
/// ESP is instead set to 0xFFFF before executing stage-2.
/// The stack will override our code if we reach it (flat mem model = 4GB...):
/// in this environment there are no "stack overflow guards".
