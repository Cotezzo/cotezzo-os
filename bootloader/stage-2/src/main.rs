    We are overwriting the os entry point with our own _start function.
    The no_mangle attribute ensures that the compiler outputs the
    function with name _start and not some cryptic unique name symbol.
    Required since we need to tell the entry point name to the linker.
    "_start" is the default entry point name for most systems.
    We also have to mark the function as extern "C" to tell the compiler that
    it should use the C calling convention for this function
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions).
    
    DS, SS, CS, ES registries are set to 0x1000, SP is set to 0 by stage-1.
    Since the Stack Pointer grows backwards, it will wrap around the segment.
    The stack will still override our code if we reach 64kB.
    In this environment there are no "stack overflow guards". */
