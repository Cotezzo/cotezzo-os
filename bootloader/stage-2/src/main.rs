    We are overwriting the os entry point with our own _start function.
    The no_mangle attribute ensures that the compiler outputs the
    function with name _start and not some cryptic unique name symbol.
    Required since we need to tell the entry point name to the linker.
    "_start" is the default entry point name for most systems.
    We also have to mark the function as extern "C" to tell the compiler that
    it should use the C calling convention for this function.
