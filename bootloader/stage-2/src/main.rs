    We also have to mark the function as extern "C" to tell the compiler that
    it should use the C calling convention for this function
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions).
    
    DS, SS, ES are set to 0x10, refers to 32pm data segment selector.
    CS register is set to 0x08, refers to 32pm code segment selector.
    SP is set to 0; since it grows backwards, it will wrap around the segment.
    The stack will override our code if we reach it (flat mem model = 4GB...):
    in this environment there are no "stack overflow guards". */
